# Code of Conduct

## What We're Building

We're working on modernizing the Dominican Republic's E-Ticket system to make travel easier for everyone. We want to build with the right values from day one.

## Our Values

- **Every traveler matters**: We care about all users, including those with disabilities, limited tech skills, or challenging situations
- **Security comes first**: We handle personal information carefully and responsibly  
- **Quality matters**: We want to build fast, accessible software that works well
- **Different views help**: Various perspectives make us build better things

## How We Work Together

### What We Encourage

**In Code:**

- Focus on user experience and accessibility
- Write safe, fast code that respects users' data and time
- Follow the Only-Once principle - don't ask users for info they've already given
- Think mobile-first and consider international needs
- Document important decisions

**In Communication:**

- Be welcoming and kind
- Respect different perspectives and experiences
- Give helpful feedback focused on improving things
- Share knowledge to help others contribute
- Own up to and learn from mistakes

### What We Don't Want

- **Ignoring security**: Adding vulnerabilities or bad security practices
- **Ignoring accessibility**: Building features that exclude users with disabilities  
- **Breaking performance**: Making the system slow
- **Being disrespectful**: Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting language
- **Discrimination**: Based on race, gender, disability, nationality, religion, or other personal traits

## Issues and Problems

### Code Problems

- Security issues: Use GitHub Security Advisories (private)
- Code quality: Open a GitHub issue

### Behavior Problems

If someone is being disrespectful or harmful:

- Open a GitHub issue or discussion
- Tag the maintainers if it's serious
- For private matters, contact maintainers directly through GitHub

## How We Handle Things

We handle issues through GitHub as they come up. We're all learning and figuring this out together.

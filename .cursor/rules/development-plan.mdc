# Development Plan & Implementation Guide

## Project Goal
Create a clickable web-based prototype showing the core user flow for a single traveler submitting an e-ticket. Focus on multi-step form entry, basic "smart form" logic, data persistence, and QR code generation upon successful submission.

## Team Structure
- **Frontend Developers**: 1-2 developers skilled in Next.js/React
- **UX/UI Designer**: 0.5 (part-time for guidance and assets)
- **Focus**: Mobile-first responsive design and "happy path" user experience

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core UI
**Objective**: Establish project foundation and basic form structure

#### Tasks
- **Project Setup**
  - Initialize Next.js App Router project
  - Integrate Shadcn/ui components
  - Setup Git repository and version control

- **Core UI Development**
  - Build main application layout (header, footer, navigation)
  - Ensure basic responsiveness using Shadcn components
  - Create mobile-first design system

- **Form Foundation**
  - Define e-ticket data model/schema using Zod
  - Build initial form sections (Personal Information, Passport Details)
  - Set up TanStack Form integration
  - Create basic routing for form steps

- **Internationalization Setup**
  - Configure next-intl for English and Spanish
  - Set up translation infrastructure

#### Deliverables
- âœ… Working Next.js project with initial backend integration setup
- âœ… Basic responsive application shell and layout
- âœ… Initial form sections with validation (non-functional submission)
- âœ… Project hosted on Vercel for easy review

### Phase 2: Form Logic & Backend Integration
**Objective**: Complete form functionality and data persistence

#### Tasks
- **Complete Form Sections**
  - Travel Details form section
  - Customs Declaration form section
  - Health Declaration form section
  - Form navigation and step management

- **Smart Form Logic Implementation**
  - Conditional field rendering based on user responses
  - Progressive disclosure patterns
  - Example: Show commercial goods fields only if "carrying goods" is "yes"

- **API Development**
  - Create Next.js API route for form submission
  - Add Zod schema validation on server-side
  - Error handling and response formatting

- **Backend Integration**
  - Add data persistence logic
  - Save e-ticket documents (specific database and path to be determined)
  - Generate unique submission IDs
  - Handle authentication state (if applicable for anonymous/draft sessions)

- **User Feedback Systems**
  - Loading states during form submission
  - Success/error messages using Shadcn Toast components
  - Form validation feedback

#### Deliverables
- âœ… Fully interactive multi-step form with conditional logic
- âœ… Successful form submission and data persistence
- âœ… Clear user feedback mechanisms for all form states

### Phase 3: QR Codes & Confirmation Flow
**Objective**: Generate QR codes and build confirmation experience

#### Tasks
- **QR Code Generation**
  - Integrate qrcode.react library
  - Generate QR codes containing essential information:
    - Submission ID
    - Traveler name
    - Basic travel details
  - Display QR code on confirmation page

- **Confirmation Page Design**
  - Create confirmation page
  - Summary of submitted information
  - QR code display and download functionality
  - Clear instructions for travelers

- **Email Confirmation (Optional)**
  - Integrate email service (e.g., Resend or other email provider services)
  - Send confirmation emails with QR code
  - Email template design for mobile readability

- **Passport OCR Proof-of-Concept (Optional)**
  - Add "Upload Passport Photo" functionality
  - Integrate OCR.space API for passport scanning
  - Extract MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) data
  - Pre-fill form fields with extracted data
  - Handle OCR errors and edge cases

- **Accessibility Review**
  - Do accessibility audit using Axe DevTools
  - Test keyboard navigation throughout application
  - Verify screen reader compatibility
  - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

#### Deliverables
- âœ… QR code generation and display system
- âœ… Confirmation page with user instructions
- ðŸŽ¯ (Optional) Basic email confirmation functionality
- ðŸŽ¯ (Optional) Client-side passport OCR for form pre-filling

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
**Objective**: Ensure production readiness and testing

#### Tasks
- **Cross-Browser Testing**
  - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  - Verify functionality across different browser versions
  - Test mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

- **Device Testing**
  - Test on actual mobile devices
  - Verify responsive design across screen sizes
  - Test touch interactions and mobile-specific features

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Run Lighthouse performance audits
  - Optimize images and assets
  - Use proper caching strategies
  - Minimize bundle sizes

- **Bug Fixes & Polish**
  - Address identified issues from testing
  - Refine UI/UX based on internal reviews
  - Polish animations and transitions
  - Improve error handling

- **Final Accessibility Audit**
  - Accessibility testing
  - Verify keyboard navigation paths
  - Test with screen readers
  - Ensure color contrast compliance

- **Documentation & Deployment**
  - Ensure stable Vercel deployment
  - Create user testing guide
  - Document known limitations
  - Prepare demo script for stakeholders

#### Deliverables
- âœ… Fully tested and deployed web-based e-ticket prototype
- âœ… Testing documentation
- âœ… User guide and demo materials
- âœ… List of known issues and improvement areas

## Success Metrics
- **Functional**: Complete user flow from form start to QR code generation
- **Performance**: Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- **Usability**: Successful completion by test users without assistance
- **Mobile Experience**: Seamless experience on smartphones and tablets

## Next Steps
1. **User Testing**: Do usability testing with diverse traveler groups
2. **Iterative Improvements**: Refine based on user feedback
3. **Native Mobile Apps**: Plan iOS and Android development
4. **Backend Scalability**: Evaluate microservices architecture needs
5. **Integration Planning**: Prepare for airline and immigration system integrations

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Use proven technology stack (Next.js, Shadcn/ui, and a suitable backend solution)
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on core functionality, mark optional goals clearly
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor and optimize from Phase 1
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Do regular accessibility reviews, not just final audit

# GitHub Project Management System

This document explains how we manage the Dominican Republic E-Ticket System project. Our system supports different development stages and welcomes various types of contributors in our open-source community.

## Overview

We use **themes instead of sprints** to organize our work. This lets us work on different parts of the system at the same time. Our setup handles research, design, coding, and improvements through automated workflows that help sort and organize tasks.

## Project Philosophy

### Open Source Collaboration

- **Everything is public**: You can see all issues and our progress
- **Everyone can contribute**: Researchers, designers, developers, testers, and subject matter experts
- **Clear process**: Easy-to-follow stages that show what's happening and who's responsible
- **Room for everyone**: Different ways to get involved based on your skills and time

### Theme-Based Organization

We group our work by **themes** - the main areas of our system:

- **üèóÔ∏è Foundation**: Core architecture, security, infrastructure
- **‚ú® Core Experience**: Essential user flows and functionality
- **üöÄ Enhanced UX**: Advanced features, optimizations, polish
- **üîí Security & Compliance**: Security measures, regulatory compliance
- **üåê Accessibility & i18n**: Internationalization, accessibility features
- **üìä Analytics & Insights**: Data collection, reporting, analytics
- **üîß Developer Experience**: Tools, documentation, testing infrastructure

## Workflow Stages

Every task moves through **7 stages**:

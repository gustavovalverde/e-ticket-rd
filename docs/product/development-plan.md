# Development Plan: Dominican Republic E-Ticket System Refactor

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a development plan to refactor the Dominican Republic's e-ticket system for migration control. The main goal is to create a modern, secure, and user-friendly digital platform using Next.js and Shadcn/ui. We want to deliver a working prototype that shows core features, focusing on better user experience and a clean interface.

## 2. Core Principles & Best Practices

The development will follow these principles:

- **User-Centric Design:** Traveler needs come first in all design and development decisions. We'll gather user feedback regularly.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Since most travelers use mobile devices, we'll design for mobile first, then adapt for desktop.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA):** The application will meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to work for people with disabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:** Fast loading and smooth interactions matter. This includes clean code, smart data handling, and optimized images.
- **Security by Design:** Security starts from day one, including data encryption, secure authentication, protection against web vulnerabilities, and safe handling of personal information.
- **Data Minimization & Privacy:** We'll only collect necessary data, following GDPR principles and local data protection rules. Users will know how their data is used.
- **Iterative Development:** An agile approach allows flexibility, quick prototyping, and ongoing improvements based on feedback.
- **Clear Communication:** Users get clear instructions, real-time validation, and confirmation at each step.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** The system will handle future growth in users and features, with clean, well-documented code.
- **Multilingual Support:** The system supports multiple languages, starting with Spanish and English, with easy addition of more.
- **Progressive Web App Features:** For the web version, PWA features (offline access for saved drafts, add to home screen) will improve the mobile web experience.

## 3. Technology Stack & Tools

- **Frontend:**

  - **Framework:** Next.js (using App Router for Server Components, better routing, and layouts)
  - **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui (accessible and customizable components built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI)
  - **State Management:** Zustand (simple and less complex than Redux) or React Context (for simpler global state needs)
  - **Form Handling:** TanStack Form (flexible form validation with features like field dependencies and async validation)
  - **Schema Validation:** Zod (data validation on both client and server, works well with TanStack Form)
  - **Internationalization:** next-intl (designed for Next.js App Router) or i18next with react-i18next
  - **Accessibility Testing:** Axe DevTools browser extension, ESLint accessibility plugins
  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via Shadcn/ui)

- **Backend:**

  - **API Layer:** Next.js API Routes (for the initial prototype, unified codebase). For scaling, these can move to dedicated microservices if needed.
  - **Database:** To be determined based on requirements. Considerations include:
    - Real-time capabilities for status updates
    - Scalability for millions of users
    - Cost efficiency
    - Data security and compliance
    - Integration capabilities
  - **Authentication:** To be determined. Requirements include:
    - Anonymous sessions for draft applications
    - Future support for user accounts
    - Secure token management
    - Session persistence

- **Passport Scanning (OCR):**

  - **Prototype (Web-based):** Client-side JavaScript OCR library like Tesseract.js for proof-of-concept to parse Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) from uploaded passport images
  - **Production (Mobile):** For production mobile app, native SDKs (Google ML Kit, Apple Vision Framework, or commercial SDKs) would be more reliable and allow direct camera access and potentially NFC reading

- **QR Code Generation:** Library like qrcode.react for generating QR codes on the client-side

- **DevOps & Collaboration:**

  - **Version Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab)
  - **Deployment:** Vercel (seamless integration with Next.js)
  - **Project Management:** Trello, Jira, or Asana for task tracking
  - **Communication:** Slack or Microsoft Teams

- **Email Notifications:** Services like SendGrid or Resend for sending email confirmations

## 4. Architecture Considerations

- **Frontend Architecture:**

  - **Component-Based:** Use Next.js and React's component model. Organize components logically (by feature or using Atomic Design principles: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages)
  - **Directory Structure:** Follow Next.js App Router conventions (app directory for routes, components directory for UI elements, lib for utilities)
  - **Server Components & Client Components:** Use Next.js Server Components for non-interactive UI parts to improve performance, and Client Components for interactive elements

- **Backend Architecture (using Next.js API Routes):**

  - **API Routes:** Define clear, RESTful API endpoints within the app/api directory
  - **Data Layer:**
    - Design for scalability and performance
    - Use smart caching strategies
    - Use efficient data structures
    - Consider offline capabilities
    - Handle errors properly
  - **Security:**
    - Use proper authentication and authorization
    - Secure session management
    - Follow OWASP security guidelines
    - Rate limiting
    - Encrypt sensitive data
  - **Data Structure:**
    - Design for efficient querying
    - Use proper indexing
    - Consider data partitioning strategies
    - Plan for data archival

- **API Design:**

  - Use Zod schemas for validating API request bodies and ensuring consistent response structures
  - Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages

- **State Management Strategy:**

  - Use React Context for simple global state (theme, user language)
  - Use Zustand for more complex client-side state related to the form or user session if needed
  - Use Next.js Server Components and Route Handlers for server-side data fetching and mutations as much as possible

- **"Smart Forms" Implementation:**
  - Use conditional rendering in React based on form state (managed by TanStack Form) to show/hide questions dynamically
  - Structure form configuration to make it easy to define dependencies between questions

## 5. Prototype Development Plan

**Goal:** A clickable web-based prototype showing the core user flow for a single traveler submitting an e-ticket. This includes multi-step form entry, basic "smart form" logic, data persistence, and QR code generation upon successful submission. Focus on the "happy path" and mobile-first responsive design.

**Team:** 1-2 Frontend Developers (skilled in Next.js/React), 0.5 UX/UI Designer (part-time for guidance and assets)

## Phase 1: Foundation, Core UI, and Initial Form Sections

- **Tasks:**

  - Project Setup: Initialize Next.js (App Router) project, integrate Shadcn/ui, setup Git repository
  - Core UI & Layout: Design and build the main application layout (header, footer, navigation placeholders) using Shadcn components. Ensure basic responsiveness
  - Form Structure Definition: Define the data model/schema for the e-ticket using Zod
  - First Form Sections: Build the initial sections of the e-ticket form (Personal Information, Passport Details) using TanStack Form and Shadcn components
  - Basic Navigation: Set up routing for different form steps
  - Internationalization Setup: Basic setup for English and Spanish using next-intl

- **Deliverables:**
  - Working Next.js project with initial backend integration setup
  - Basic application shell and responsive layout
  - Initial form sections with validation (non-functional submission)
  - Project hosted on Vercel for easy review

## Phase 2: Completing Form Logic, API Routes, and Data Persistence

- **Tasks:**

  - Remaining Form Sections: Build all remaining sections of the e-ticket form (Travel Details, Customs Declaration, Health Declaration)
  - "Smart Form" Logic: Add conditional logic to show/hide questions based on previous answers (e.g., if "carrying commercial goods" is yes, show related questions)
  - API Route for Submission: Create a Next.js API route to handle form submission
  - Data Persistence:
    - Add logic in the API route to validate data (using Zod schema) and save the complete e-ticket document. For the prototype, this can be a temporary solution like a local JSON file, proving the end-to-end flow
    - Generate a unique ID for each submission
  - Client-Side Submission Logic: Connect the frontend form to the submission API route
  - User Feedback: Add loading states and success/error messages for form submission (using Shadcn Toasts or custom alerts, no window.alert())

- **Deliverables:**
  - Fully interactive multi-step form with conditional logic
  - Successful submission and data persistence shown with a proof-of-concept
  - Clear user feedback on submission status

## Phase 3: QR Code, Confirmation, and Basic OCR

- **Tasks:**

  - QR Code Generation: Upon successful form submission, generate a QR code containing essential information (submission ID, traveler name). Display this on a confirmation page and/or make it downloadable. Use qrcode.react
  - Confirmation Page: Design and build a clear confirmation page summarizing key submitted details and displaying the QR code
  - Basic Email Confirmation (Optional): If time permits, integrate a simple email notification (using Resend or another email provider) sending the QR code and confirmation
  - Passport OCR Proof-of-Concept (Optional):
    - Add an "Upload Passport Photo" option
    - Integrate Tesseract.js to try to extract MRZ data from the uploaded image on the client-side
    - Use extracted data to pre-fill relevant form fields. This is a proof-of-concept and may have limitations
  - Accessibility Review: Do an initial accessibility check using Axe DevTools and keyboard navigation

- **Deliverables:**
  - QR code generation and display on a confirmation page
  - (Optional) Basic email confirmation
  - (Optional) Basic client-side passport OCR functionality for pre-filling

## Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, Deployment, and Documentation

- **Tasks:**

  - End-to-End Testing: Test the entire user flow on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile devices/emulators
  - Bug Fixing & UI Polishing: Address any identified bugs and refine the UI/UX based on internal reviews
  - Performance Checks: Basic performance review (Lighthouse)
  - Final Accessibility Checks: Ensure basic accessibility requirements are met for the prototype
  - Deployment: Ensure the prototype is stably deployed to Vercel (or chosen platform)
  - Basic Documentation: Prepare a brief document outlining the prototype's features, how to test it, and known limitations
  - Prepare for Feedback: Outline questions for gathering feedback on the prototype

- **Deliverables:**
  - A deployed, tested, and refined web-based e-ticket prototype
  - Basic user guide/demo script
  - List of known issues and areas for future improvement

## 6. Next Steps

- **User Testing & Feedback:** Do usability testing with a diverse group of representative travelers
- **Iterative Enhancements:** Refine the prototype based on user feedback, addressing pain points and adding high-value features
- **Native Mobile App Development:** Begin planning and development of dedicated iOS and Android applications for a better mobile experience, including offline capabilities, secure credential storage, and advanced OCR/NFC passport scanning
- **Backend Scalability:** If Next.js API routes become a bottleneck, plan migration to a dedicated, scalable backend (microservices architecture using Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or Java/Spring Boot, hosted on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- **Integrations:**
  - Airline Systems (API): For pre-filling flight information, APIS
  - Immigration Databases: For verification and data synchronization
  - eGates: For seamless border crossing
  - Payment Gateways (if any fees are introduced for specific services in the future)
- **Advanced Security & Compliance:**
  - Security audits and penetration testing
  - Full compliance with ICAO standards and data privacy regulations
- **Admin Portal:** Develop a secure administrative interface for system management, monitoring, reporting, and user support
- **Accessibility Audit & Certification**

## 7. Conclusion

This development plan provides a roadmap for creating a significantly improved e-ticket system for the Dominican Republic. By using Next.js and Shadcn/ui, and following user-centric design principles, we can quickly develop a prototype that shows the potential for a world-class digital migration experience. The iterative approach will ensure that the final product is stable, user-friendly, and effectively meets the needs of both travelers and migration authorities.

# Development Plan: Dominican Republic E-Ticket System Refactor

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a development plan to refactor the Dominican Republic's e-ticket system for
migration control. The primary objective is to create a modern, secure, and exceptionally
user-friendly digital platform using Next.js and Shadcn/ui. We aim to deliver a working prototype
demonstrating core functionalities within a 4-week timeframe, focusing on an enhanced user
experience (UX) and a streamlined user interface (UI).

## 2. Core Principles & Best Practices (The General Picture)

The development will be guided by the following principles and best practices:

- **User-Centric Design (UCD):** The traveler's needs and experience will be at the forefront of all
  design and development decisions. Continuous user feedback will be sought.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Given the prevalence of mobile device usage among travelers, the system
  will be designed and optimized for mobile experiences first, then scaled to desktop.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA):** The application will be developed to meet or exceed Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1/2.2 Level AA to ensure usability for people with
  disabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:** Fast load times and smooth interactions are critical. This includes
  optimized code, efficient data handling, and image optimization.
- **Security by Design:** Security considerations will be integrated from the outset, including data
  encryption, secure authentication, protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10),
  and secure handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Data Minimization & Privacy:** Only essential data will be collected, in compliance with GDPR
  principles and local data protection regulations. Users will be informed about how their data is
  used.
- **Iterative Development (Agile):** An agile methodology will allow for flexibility, rapid
  prototyping, and continuous improvement based on feedback.
- **Clear Communication & Feedback Mechanisms:** Users will receive clear instructions, real-time
  validation, and confirmation at each step.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** The architecture will be designed to handle future growth in
  user load and feature enhancements, with clean, well-documented code.
- **Multilingual Support:** The system will support multiple languages, starting with Spanish and
  English, with the ability to easily add more.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Considerations:** For the web version, PWA features (e.g., offline
  access for saved drafts, add to home screen) will be considered to enhance the mobile web
  experience.

## 3. Technology Stack & Tools

- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** Next.js (using the App Router for modern features like Server Components,
    improved routing, and layouts).
  - **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui (leveraging its accessible and customizable components built on
    Tailwind CSS and Radix UI).
  - **State Management:** Zustand (simple, scalable, and less boilerplate than Redux) or React
    Context (for simpler global state needs in the prototype).
  - **Form Handling:** React Hook Form (for performant, flexible, and easy-to-use form validation).
  - **Schema Validation:** Zod (for robust data validation on both client and server, integrates
    well with React Hook Form).
  - **Internationalization (i18n):** next-intl (specifically designed for Next.js App Router) or
    i18next with react-i18next.
  - **Accessibility Testing:** Axe DevTools browser extension, ESLint accessibility plugins
    (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).
  - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via Shadcn/ui).
- **Backend (for Prototype & Scalable Future):**
  - **API Layer:** Next.js API Routes (for the initial prototype, offering a unified codebase). For
    scaling, these can be migrated to dedicated microservices if needed.
  - **Database:** To be determined based on requirements analysis. Considerations include:
    - Real-time capabilities for status updates
    - Scalability for millions of users
    - Cost efficiency
    - Data security and compliance
    - Integration capabilities
  - **Authentication:** To be determined. Requirements include:
    - Anonymous sessions for draft applications
    - Future support for user accounts
    - Secure token management
    - Session persistence
- **Passport Scanning (OCR \- Optical Character Recognition):**
  - **Prototype (Web-based PoC):** A client-side JavaScript OCR library like Tesseract.js can be
    used for a proof-of-concept to parse the Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) from an uploaded passport
    image.
  - **Production (Mobile):** For a production-grade mobile app, native SDKs (e.g., Google ML Kit,
    Apple Vision Framework, or commercial SDKs) would be more robust and allow for direct camera
    access and potentially NFC reading.
- **QR Code Generation:**
  - A library like qrcode.react for generating QR codes on the client-side.
- **DevOps & Collaboration:**
  - **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  - **Deployment (Prototype):** Vercel (seamless integration with Next.js).
  - **Project Management:** Trello, Jira, or Asana for task tracking.
  - **Communication:** Slack or Microsoft Teams.
- **Email Notifications (Optional for Prototype):**
  - Services like SendGrid or Resend for sending email confirmations.

## 4. Architectural Considerations

- **Frontend Architecture:**
  - **Component-Based:** Leverage Next.js and React's component model. Organize components logically
    (e.g., by feature or using Atomic Design principles: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates,
    Pages).
  - **Directory Structure:** Use Next.js App Router conventions (app directory for routes,
    components directory for UI elements, lib for utilities, etc.).
  - **Server Components & Client Components:** Strategically use Next.js Server Components for parts
    of the UI that don't require interactivity to improve performance, and Client Components for
    interactive elements.
- **Backend Architecture (using Next.js API Routes):**
  - **API Routes:** Define clear, RESTful API endpoints within the app/api directory.
  - **Data Layer:**
    - Design for scalability and performance
    - Implement proper caching strategies
    - Use efficient data structures
    - Consider offline capabilities
    - Implement proper error handling
  - **Security:**
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization
    - Use secure session management
    - Follow OWASP security guidelines
    - Implement rate limiting
    - Use proper encryption for sensitive data
  - **Data Structure:**
    - Design for efficient querying
    - Implement proper indexing
    - Consider data partitioning strategies
    - Plan for data archival
- **API Design:**
  - Use Zod schemas for validating API request bodies and ensuring consistent response structures.
  - Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages.
- **State Management Strategy:**
  - Use React Context for simple global state (e.g., theme, user language).
  - Use Zustand for more complex client-side state related to the form or user session if needed.
  - Leverage Next.js Server Components and Route Handlers for server-side data fetching and
    mutations as much as possible.
- **"Smart Forms" Implementation:**
  - Use conditional rendering in React based on form state (managed by React Hook Form) to show/hide
    questions dynamically.
  - Structure form configuration in a way that makes it easy to define dependencies between
    questions.

## 5. 4-Week Prototype Development Plan

**Goal:** A clickable web-based prototype demonstrating the core user flow for a single traveler
submitting an e-ticket. This includes multi-step form entry (manual), basic "smart form" logic, data
persistence to Firestore, and QR code generation upon successful submission. Focus on the "happy
path" and mobile-first responsive design.

**Team (Illustrative):** 1-2 Frontend Developers (proficient in Next.js/React), 0.5 UX/UI Designer
(part-time for guidance and assets).

## Week 1: Foundation, Core UI, and Initial Form Sections

- **Tasks:**
  - Project Setup: Initialize Next.js (App Router) project, integrate Shadcn/ui, setup Git
    repository.
  - Firebase Setup: Create Firebase project, enable Firestore and Authentication (Anonymous).
    Configure Firebase SDK in the Next.js app using provided global variables (\_\_firebase_config,
    \_\_app_id, \_\_initial_auth_token).
  - Core UI & Layout: Design and implement the main application layout (header, footer, navigation
    placeholders) using Shadcn components. Ensure basic responsiveness.
  - Form Structure Definition: Define the data model/schema for the e-ticket using Zod.
  - First Form Sections: Implement the initial sections of the e-ticket form (e.g., Personal
    Information, Passport Details) using React Hook Form and Shadcn components.
  - Basic Navigation: Set up routing for different form steps.
  - Internationalization (i18n) Setup: Basic setup for English and Spanish using next-intl.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Working Next.js project with Firebase integration.
  - Basic application shell and responsive layout.
  - Initial (non-functional submission) form sections with validation.
  - Project hosted on Vercel for easy review.

## Week 2: Completing Form Logic, API Routes, and Firestore Integration

- **Tasks:**
  - Remaining Form Sections: Implement all remaining sections of the e-ticket form (Travel Details,
    Customs Declaration, Health Declaration).
  - "Smart Form" Logic: Implement conditional logic to show/hide questions based on previous answers
    (e.g., if "carrying commercial goods" is yes, show related questions).
  - API Route for Submission: Create a Next.js API route to handle form submission.
  - Firestore Data Persistence:
    - Implement logic in the API route to validate data (using Zod schema) and save the complete
      e-ticket document to Firestore under the correct path (e.g.,
      /artifacts/${appId}/users/${userId}/eTickets/{ticketId}).
    - Generate a unique ID for each submission.
  - Client-Side Submission Logic: Connect the frontend form to the submission API route.
  - User Feedback: Implement loading states and success/error messages for form submission (using
    Shadcn Toasts or custom alerts, no window.alert()).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Fully interactive multi-step form with conditional logic.
  - Successful submission and data persistence to Firestore.
  - Clear user feedback on submission status.

## Week 3: QR Code, Confirmation, and Basic OCR PoC

- **Tasks:**
  - QR Code Generation: Upon successful form submission, generate a QR code containing essential
    information (e.g., submission ID, traveler name). Display this on a confirmation page and/or
    make it downloadable. Use qrcode.react.
  - Confirmation Page/Mechanism: Design and implement a clear confirmation page summarizing key
    submitted details and displaying the QR code.
  - Basic Email Confirmation (Stretch Goal): If time permits, integrate a simple email notification
    (e.g., using Resend or Firebase Functions with an email provider) sending the QR code and
    confirmation.
  - Passport OCR Proof-of-Concept (Stretch Goal):
    - Add an "Upload Passport Photo" option.
    - Integrate Tesseract.js to attempt to extract MRZ data from the uploaded image on the
      client-side.
    - Use extracted data to pre-fill relevant form fields. This is a PoC and may have limitations.
  - Accessibility Review: Conduct an initial accessibility check using Axe DevTools and keyboard
    navigation.
- **Deliverables:**
  - QR code generation and display on a confirmation page.
  - (Stretch) Basic email confirmation.
  - (Stretch) Rudimentary client-side passport OCR functionality for pre-filling.

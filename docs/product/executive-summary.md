# Executive Summary: Modernizing the Dominican Republic's E-Ticket System for an Enhanced Traveler Experience

**1\. Objective: What We Aim to Achieve**

The primary goal is to strategically refactor the Dominican Republic's current e-ticket system for migration control (<https://eticket.migracion.gob.do/>). This initiative seeks to develop a modern, secure, and exceptionally user-friendly digital platform for travelers entering or departing the country. The envisioned system will significantly improve the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), streamline data collection, enhance operational efficiency for border authorities, and align with international best practices, ultimately boosting traveler satisfaction and the nation's image as a technologically advanced destination.

**2\. Benchmark Selection: Why New Zealand and Singapore?**

New Zealand's Traveller Declaration (NZTD) and Singapore's Arrival Card (SGAC) were selected as benchmarks due to their global recognition as leading examples of effective and user-centric digital migration systems.

- **New Zealand Traveller Declaration (NZTD):** Chosen for its comprehensive approach, strong mobile-first strategy (including a dedicated app with passport scanning and offline capabilities), clear communication, commitment to accessibility and multilingualism, and its phased, iterative development that incorporates "smart questions" to minimize data entry. Its electronic linkage to passports for seamless eGate processing is a key strength.
- **Singapore Arrival Card (SGAC):** Selected for its highly streamlined and efficient process, primarily facilitated through the "MyICA" mobile application. Strengths include passport bio-data scanning, efficient group submission features, and clear, reliable communication with travelers (e.g., QR code and email confirmations).

These systems exemplify best practices in areas crucial for the Dominican Republic's refactoring project: intuitive UX/UI, mobile optimization, efficient and accurate data capture (like passport scanning), robust backend integration, multilingual support, and accessibility.

**3\. Current System Issues: Challenges with the Existing Dominican Republic E-Ticket**

Analysis of user feedback and official guides for the current eticket.migracion.gob.do/ system reveals several significant pain points:

- **Technical Glitches and Incompatibility:** Users report frequent issues such as browser incompatibility (e.g., problems with Chrome, requiring Edge), the system unexpectedly reverting to Spanish, and, critically, instances of "lost forms" where completed submissions are not found or acknowledged, severely eroding trust. Lack of reliable email confirmations with QR codes is also a concern.
- **Poor User Experience (UX) and Usability:** The form is often perceived as lengthy or complex. Users encounter unclear field requirements (e.g., unlisted home cities, detailed address needs for rentals without easy lookups). There's no dedicated, optimized mobile application, and the system relies solely on manual data entry without features like passport scanning.
- **Inconsistent Processes and Communication:** A major frustration is the inconsistent requirement and use of the generated QR code by airline staff and border officials. This, coupled with insufficient guidance from airlines and sometimes conflicting information, leads to confusion, last-minute rushes, and operational delays at airports.
- **External Threats:** The prevalence of third-party scam websites charging for the officially free e-ticket service further damages the system's credibility and can mislead travelers.

**4\. Path to Improvement: Key Enhancements for the New System**

Drawing lessons from the benchmark systems and addressing current deficiencies, the refactored Dominican Republic e-ticket system should focus on the following improvements:

- **Radically Improved User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI):**
  - Adopt a user-centric design (UCD) methodology throughout the project.
  - Develop a **mobile-first native application** (iOS and Android) featuring passport scanning (OCR/NFC), offline data entry, profile saving for repeat travelers, and streamlined group/family submissions.
  - Overhaul the web portal to be fully responsive, cross-browser compatible, and highly accessible (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA).
- **Streamlined and Intelligent Data Collection:**
  - Implement **"smart forms"** with extensive conditional logic to dynamically tailor the form to each user, only asking relevant questions.
  - Break down the form into clear, manageable steps with progress indicators.
  - Prioritize **data minimization**, collecting only essential information.
- **Robust Multilingual and Accessibility Support:**
  - Provide comprehensive and high-quality translations in key tourist languages.
  - Ensure persistent language selection and adherence to accessibility standards from the outset.
- **Clear Communication and Reliable Processes:**
  - Ensure immediate, clear on-screen and email confirmations with QR codes.
  - Provide unambiguous instructions on QR code usage and ensure consistent enforcement through training and airline integration.
- **Technical Excellence and Security:**
  - Build a stable, scalable, and secure backend architecture (potentially cloud-native) to prevent data loss and ensure high availability.
  - Implement an API-driven architecture to facilitate integrations with airline systems, eGates, and other government services.
  - Adhere to stringent data security (e.g., GDPR principles, ISO 27001\) and ICAO standards.
- **Strategic Use of Technology:**
  - Consider a hybrid approach for technology, potentially leveraging well-supported, government-focused open-source components (like GOV.UK Forms for frontend principles) combined with robust backend workflow engines (like Camunda or Flowable) and custom development where necessary.

By implementing these improvements through a phased approach, the Dominican Republic can create a world-class e-ticket system that enhances border security, improves operational efficiency, and provides a welcoming, seamless experience for all travelers.

# Security Policy

## Why Security Matters

This project aims to handle traveler information for the Dominican Republic E-Ticket System. We want to build with security in mind from day one.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Found a security problem?** Please don't post it publicly.

### How to Report

**Use GitHub Security Advisories:**

1. Go to the "Security" tab in this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Tell us what you found

**What to Include:**

- What the problem is
- How to reproduce it (if you can)
- What parts of the code are affected
- How serious you think it is

We'll do our best to respond quickly, but keep in mind this is an open source project maintained on a best-effort basis.

## What We're Building Toward

As this project grows, we want to follow good security practices:

- **Input validation** using proper schemas
- **HTTPS everywhere**
- **Safe database queries**
- **Encrypt sensitive data**
- **Regular dependency updates**
- **Follow OWASP guidelines**

## How We Handle Security

- We don't have formal SLAs or response times
- Everything is handled through GitHub (no separate emails or teams)
- Fixes depend on contributor availability
- We welcome security-focused contributions

## For Contributors

When adding code:

- Validate all user inputs
- Don't log sensitive information
- Use secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Think about potential security impacts

**Remember**: Every security decision we make now affects the project's future. Let's build it right from the beginning.
